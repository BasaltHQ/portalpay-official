# Shopify App Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy Shopify apps for whitelabel brands using the automated deployment pipeline.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Shopify CLI

The deployment pipeline requires Shopify CLI to be installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme
```

Verify installation:
```bash
shopify version
```

### 2. Create Partner API Token

1. Go to [Shopify Partners Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Partner API clients**
3. Click **Manage Partner API clients**
4. Create a new API client with **Manage apps** permission
5. Copy the access token

### 3. Get Organization ID

Your Organization ID is in the URL when viewing your Partners Dashboard:
```
https://partners.shopify.com/YOUR_ORG_ID/...
```

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` or `.env.local`:

```env
# Shopify Deployment Configuration
SHOPIFY_CLI_PARTNERS_TOKEN=your_partner_api_token_here
SHOPIFY_ORG_ID=your_organization_id_here
```

For Azure deployment, add these to your Key Vault or Container App environment variables.

## Deployment Flow

### Step 1: Configure Plugin in Plugin Studio

1. Go to Admin → Plugin Studio
2. Select your brand (e.g., `paynex`)
3. Configure the Shopify plugin:
   - **Configuration tab**: Set app name, tagline, icons, banners
   - **OAuth tab**: Configure redirect URLs and access scopes
   - **Extension tab**: Enable checkout UI extension and customize

### Step 2: Check Deployment Readiness

Call the status endpoint to verify prerequisites:

```bash
curl "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/shopify/apps/status?brandKey=paynex"
```

Response shows a checklist:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": "ready_to_deploy",
  "checklist": [
    { "id": "cli_installed", "label": "Shopify CLI installed", "completed": true },
    { "id": "partners_token", "label": "Partner API token configured", "completed": true },
    { "id": "org_id", "label": "Organization ID configured", "completed": true },
    { "id": "plugin_name", "label": "App name configured", "completed": true },
    { "id": "redirect_urls", "label": "OAuth redirect URLs configured", "completed": true },
    { "id": "scopes", "label": "Access scopes configured", "completed": true }
  ],
  "environment": {
    "cliInstalled": true,
    "cliVersion": "3.x.x",
    "hasPartnersToken": true,
    "hasOrgId": true,
    "ready": true
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy the App

Click "Deploy App" in Plugin Studio or call the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/shopify/apps/deploy" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"brandKey": "paynex"}'
```

The deployment process:
1. Validates CLI and environment setup
2. Loads plugin configuration
3. Generates Shopify app project files
4. Runs `shopify app deploy` with your credentials
5. Extracts app ID/client ID from output
6. Updates database with deployment info

### Step 4: Verify in Shopify Partners

After successful deployment:
1. Go to [Shopify Partners Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Navigate to **Apps**
3. Your new app should appear in the list
4. Click to configure additional settings if needed

## Manual Deployment Alternative

If the automated CLI deployment fails, you can use the Package endpoint to generate a ZIP file:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/shopify/apps/package" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"brandKey": "paynex"}'
```

This returns a download URL for a ZIP containing:
- `shopify.app.toml` - App configuration
- `extensions/checkout-ui/` - Checkout extension files
- `README.md` - Manual deployment instructions

Then manually deploy using Shopify CLI:

```bash
unzip paynex-shopify-app.zip -d paynex-app
cd paynex-app
npm install
shopify app deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Shopify CLI not installed"

Install the CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme
```

### "Missing SHOPIFY_CLI_PARTNERS_TOKEN"

Create a Partner API token:
1. Partners Dashboard → Settings → Partner API clients
2. Create new client with "Manage apps" permission
3. Set `SHOPIFY_CLI_PARTNERS_TOKEN` environment variable

### "Missing SHOPIFY_ORG_ID"

Find your organization ID in the Partners Dashboard URL and set `SHOPIFY_ORG_ID`.

### "Deployment failed"

Check the logs in the response. Common issues:
- Invalid token permissions
- CLI authentication expired
- Network issues with Shopify API

Try the manual deployment method as a fallback.

### App not showing in Partners Dashboard

1. Check the status endpoint for `appId` and `clientId`
2. Verify the organization ID is correct
3. Try refreshing the Partners Dashboard
4. Check if the app was created under a different organization
