## Revenue-Based Discount Structure

Partners can reduce their monthly subscription fee to **$0.00** by reaching specific revenue thresholds generated through the platform. The discount structure is designed to reward successful partners while managing platform risk, with the fee reducing to $0 once PortalPay earns a **500% margin** on the monthly subscription through processing revenue.

**Important:** Discounts are **performance-based and dynamic**. Partners must maintain the processing volume thresholds each month to retain their discount tier. If monthly processing volume declines, the subscription fee will adjust upward to the corresponding tier based on that month's actual volume.

### Milestone-Based Reduction Schedule

At **50 basis points (0.005)** platform revenue share, the monthly fee structure works as follows:

**Monthly Subscription: $2,195**
- Partner reaches $0 monthly fee when generating **$2,195,000** in monthly processing volume
- At 0.5% platform revenue: $2,195,000 × 0.005 = **$10,975/month** (500% of $2,195 subscription)

### Progressive Discount Milestones

| Monthly Processing Volume | Platform Revenue @ 0.5% | Monthly Subscription Fee | Margin Achieved |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| $0 - $878,999 | $0 - $4,394 | $2,195 (100%) | <200% |
| $879,000 - $1,316,999 | $4,395 - $6,584 | $1,646 (75%) | 200% - 300% |
| $1,317,000 - $1,755,999 | $6,585 - $8,779 | $1,098 (50%) | 300% - 400% |
| $1,756,000 - $2,194,999 | $8,780 - $10,974 | $549 (25%) | 400% - 500% |
| **$2,195,000+** | **$10,975+** | **$0 (0%)** | **500%+** |

**Dynamic Adjustment Policy:**
- Subscription fees are recalculated monthly based on the previous month's actual processing volume
- If volume increases, the partner immediately benefits from reduced fees for the following month
- If volume decreases, the fee increases to match the appropriate tier for the following month
- There is no "lock-in" period - fees adjust up or down based on ongoing performance

*Note: Revenue thresholds may be adjusted based on industry-specific factors and market saturation levels (see Industry Considerations below).*

## Industry Considerations

### Industry-Specific Scaling

Pricing and discount thresholds may be adjusted based on:
- **Target industry vertical** (e.g., restaurant, retail, hospitality, professional services)
- **Market saturation** in general market and on platform
- **Industry-specific margins and transaction volumes**
- **Competitive landscape** within the target vertical

**Discussion Point:** Should we implement industry-specific discount scales or maintain a flat structure across all verticals? Industry-specific scales would allow more nuanced positioning but increase complexity. Flat scales provide simplicity and consistency.

### Mobile App Deployment Notes

For partners selecting the Mobile App package:

**Android Deployment:**
- Standard APK distribution through signed artifacts
- Container-specific branding and configuration

**Apple (iOS) Deployment:**
- Recommended approaches to bypass App Store review scrutiny:
  - **Apple Configurator**: Direct device provisioning for enterprise deployment
  - **MDM (Mobile Device Management)**: Centralized app distribution without App Store
- Alternative: App Store submission (subject to Apple review process delays and requirements)

---

## What's Included

Setup fee covers container provisioning, brand identity configuration, artifact gating, CI/CD pipeline setup, wallet configuration, and (if selected) white-labeled mobile application development. Subscription includes partner-branded container operation, brand isolation, split validation services, signed APK distribution (if applicable), 3 hours/month technical support (business hours), and sponsored gas fees for in-app wallet transactions (invoiced at $100 cumulative threshold).

---

## Payment Terms

Invoices due immediately upon receipt. Late payments accrue 1.5%/month interest. Fees exclude applicable taxes. Support overage billed at $150/hour (30-min increments, pre-approved). Custom development requires separate SOW. Revenue-based discounts calculated monthly based on previous month's verified platform revenue.

## Year 1 Summary (Base Monthly Package)

| Plan Component | Base Container | Container + Mobile App |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Setup Fee | $14,950 | $20,995 |
| Monthly Subscription (Year 1) | $26,340<br>(12 × $2,195) | $26,340<br>(12 × $2,195) |
| **Total Year 1** | **$41,290** | **$47,335** |

*Note: Monthly fees may be reduced through revenue-based discount structure. Calculations assume standard monthly rate without revenue discounts applied.*

---

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Higher monthly fees** are structured to incentivize partners to drive platform revenue and earn discounts, reducing PortalPay's risk from partners who may not achieve market traction.

2. **Reduced setup fees** lower the initial barrier to entry, making the Partner package more accessible while the platform retains revenue through monthly subscriptions until partners prove their market viability.

3. **Revenue-based discounts** align PortalPay's success with partner success, creating a true partnership model where both parties benefit from growth.

4. **Mobile app premium** reflects the additional development, maintenance, and deployment complexity for native applications.
